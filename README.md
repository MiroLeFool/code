# Carl University Student Learning Management System
This is a school project i made, designed similarly to most student instructures, so most features that are doable within my rudimentary skills are added.

#web.html
The navigation menu/homepage, most of the images function as hyperlinks to other webpages according to the user's needs.
I used a javascript event listener to show error for dysfunctional hyperlinks.

#dsb.html
The dashboard for local events/news, as it is a fake university i did not put much effort into making the local news.
There's a back/forward button for navigation

#dir.html
The school directory, most of the information here are of course fake, i used some NBA Stars as staff.

#sub.html
The subjects page, most of the subjects in Computer Studies are listed here, i designed it with basic CSS.
(also added a Go to Webpage button for easy navigation)
